# NBody
Hi, I'm glad you decided to watch this mini-project. This mini-project will show you how our Solar System moves throughout the year. You must have IntelJ Idea to run the NBody project. Just open terminal and write following:

javac-introcs NBody.java

Then press Enter. On a new line, write:

java-introcs NBody 157788000.0 25000.0 < planets.txt

Does it look funny?
